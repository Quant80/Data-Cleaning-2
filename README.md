# Data-Cleaning-2
Instructions

1. Write a Python program to process the following data file:

Your program will then accomplish and show the result of the following tasks:

1. Use the three "Surcharge" columns and provide summary statistics for all three columns. Find and show the missing counts for both rows and columns. For each column, show how many values are missing. For rows, show a table with the number of entries missing and how many rows have that exact number of entries missing.
2. Show all the rows that have some missing values in them for the 'Surcharge' columns.
3.Display 20 quantiles for the "Surcharge" columns, from 0% to 100% in steps of 5%..
4.Show all rows that contain 3 or more missing values.
6.Test all "Surcharge" columns for normality. Comment on your results.
7.Using the Inter-Quartile Ranges, find all outliers in all numeric columns. Show the rows containing outliers, along with the variable (column) name (for each row) that had the outlier value.
7.Make a histogram for the "Illinois Surcharge" column. Make sure to use appropriate number of bins and appropriate histogram labels.
8.Explore your dataset. Choose 5 different numerical columns, and display the correlation matrix.
9.Choose two columns from your dataset that have strong correlation. Show a crosstab of these two columns, with at least 5 entries.
10.Based on the results shown in the crosstab, identify and show all rows that appear to contain outliers.
11.For your two chosen columns, show a scatterplot. Identify the outliers on the scatterplot. Display the rows that appear to be outliers, based on the scatterplot data.

NB.When working on your assignments, create a folder in your path called "data". Please put all your data files in the "data" folder. There is no need to turn in the data files, unless you have used your own, separate data files.
